# Mass cytometry

Mass cytometry is a powerful technology that combines principles of flow
cytometry and mass spectrometry for in-depth, single-cell analysis. This
is how it works:

-   **Antibody labeling:** Antibodies conjugated to heavy metal isotopesare used to tag proteins on or inside cells.
-   **Ionization:** Individual cells are nebulized and introduced into an inductively coupled plasma (ICP), where they are vaporized and their metal tags ionized.
-   **Mass detection:** The ions are then separated and quantified based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) using a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer.
-   **Output:** Each cell is represented by the intensity of ~40-50 isotopes, enabling high-dimensional single-cell analysis.
-   **Limitation:** The above describe process destroys the cells, preventing their use in downstream applications.

AI tools used:

-   Gemini

-   Perplexity

-   ChatGPT

Prompts used:

1) How does mass cytometry work?

2) Can you give me a shorter abstract (4-5 bullet points)

--> We then manually merged the versions from the tools used.
